# Redis OM Aggregation + Express

[redis-om](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-om) is an amazing package to perform redis search because it provides schema, repository pattern like mongoose.
 But currently it doesn't provide any aggregation feature for nodejs. To implement aggregation using redis commands in js code can be very complex and time consuming. This repo contains an example solution to use aggregation on top of redis-om. You can perform aggregation in the same way as redis search.
